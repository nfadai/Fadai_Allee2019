Accompanying MATLAB applets

Two MATLAB applets that compliment the results presented in this work are available in this GitHub repository. In the first, called ``InverseApp'', a user-specified per-capita growth rate, f(C)= (1/C)(dC/dt), is input using the upper-case letter C. The per-capita growth rate must have f(1)<=0$ and f(0)<infinity; an error message is displayed otherwise. Multiplication of terms is denoted using the `.^*' MATLAB operation and division of terms is denoted using the `./' MATLAB operation. Upon clicking the blue ``Compute Rates'' button, the corresponding IBM parameters p_n and alpha_n are determined via equations (11) and (12) in the main document. The initial condition, C(0) can be input as a numerical value in the word bubble, or changed using the slider. Furthermore, L IBM simulations can be run using the green ``Run IBM'' button, where L is the user-specified number of IBM realisations. The averaged density data is then plotted in red against the continuum limit solution, shown in black.

In the second applet, called ``ExpFitApp2'', user-input experimental data is fit to a choice of common per-capita growth rates. The experimental data must be saved as an Excel xls file in the same folder as the applet, with the first column specifying the time points and the second column specifying the population density data. The name of the data is then typed into the ``XLS File Name'' bubble, where the `.xls' file extension is omitted. The user can then choose from one of four population models: logistic growth, the Weak Allee effect, the Strong Allee effect, or the Hyper-Allee effect. The Hyper-Allee effect must have two distinct experimental datasets included so that both stable equilibria of the model can be accurately determined. An initial guess of model parameters can be specified prior to clicking the green ``Fit to Model'' button, or unspecified. Two plots are shown on the right-hand side of the applet. The top displays the experimental data and best-fit model parameters, and the bottom displays a rescaled population density curve c, determined via methods discussed in Section S5 (Supplementary Information). Finally, the corresponding IBM parameters of the rescaled continuum model are displayed at the bottom of the applet, determined via equations (11) and (12) in the main document.
